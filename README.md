## My process
My process was a little bit tough withe fact that this is my first project since after my exams. It took a while to get used to writting with Material Ui again and learning how to implement icons, overwritting the theme and all.

### Built with
- Material Ui
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned
I finally learnt how to make responsive webpages with material Ui and i can't lie, it's easier than with plain css.

### Continued development
I plan on working a lot more with Material Ui, building more projects and experimenting with more tools in react. It's a new year and i plan to start React Native mid way through this year, really looking forward to it!ðŸ˜Š
